### Today I Work
#### Title 1: Multiple Classification
- Movie Total Audience 5M
- Increasing the explanatory power of the model by separating those with more than 5 million viewers from those with lower and higher audiences up to week two.
- Training Machine Learning - CatBoost, LightGBM
- Predict recent movie's office

### Today's Assignment and How to Solve
#### Assignment 1 : Separate 5M Viewers
There are several variables in the box office data. Therefore, binary classification was conducted with the K-Means machine learning algorithm. One is open-concentrated in the beginning, and the other is word of mouth in the second half.  
The reason for this is that the prediction performance of the model is poor when binary classification (less than 5 million or more) has been performed in the past.

#### Assignment 2 : Training Model
This results in a multi-classification problem that requires predicting a total of three classes.  
CatBoost and LightGBM were used as models. For parameter tuning, optuna and Random Search were used. Variable selection was conducted by dividing into important variable groups and less important variable groups using the feature_importance method.

#### Assignment 3 : Predict
As of September 6, 2025, the total number of viewers was predicted for the films still being screened.  
As of October 17, there were a total of three films with more than 5 million. One of the films accurately predicted that it would exceed 5 million (좀비딸), but the other two were predicted to exceed 5 million. (F1 더 무비, 귀멸의 칼날 : 무한성편)
### Today's Momoirs
- Depending on the characteristics of the model, it was found that not only binary classification but also other methods should be used.
- However, the performance is not good yet. If it is not a data size problem, you need to use a different model.
